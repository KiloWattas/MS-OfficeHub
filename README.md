# MS-OfficeHub
Repository that hosts links to official MS Office downloads and provides automated KMS activation tools.

This repository hosts text files containing links to download official MS office installers as well as python scripts that automates KMS activation process. Scripts require administrative privileges in order to execute corrently. If the script is not run as administrator, it will evoke UAC prompt and ask for elevation itself.

Scripts do not require any additional dependencies to be installed. It takes advantage of libraries that are already included in Python Standart Library: <code>os</code>,  <code>ctypes</code> and <code>sys</code>.

Scripts had been written in <code>Python 3.11.1</code> and tested on <code>Windows 10 22H2</code> machine.
